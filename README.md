Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment 
By Rushikesh Naidu

Overview

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. . A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository . In this project , we have acquired an existing dataset and cleaned it as per our reuqirements . Further we generated a new independent tidy data set based on several parameters.

The source data for this project can be found here.

Making Modifications to This Script

Once the source files are unizpped to your working directory , you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data. .

Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file
